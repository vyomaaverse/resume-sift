# Resume Sift

A typical job posting on the Internet receives a massive number of applications within a short window of time. Manually filtering out the resumes is not practically possible as it takes a lot of time and incurs huge costs that the hiring companies cannot afford to bear. In addition, this process of screening resumes is not fair as many suitable profiles donâ€™t get enough consideration which they deserve. This may result in missing out on the right candidates or selection of unsuitable applicants for the job. 

### Resume sift comes to rescue

In this project, we came up with a solution that aims to solve these issues by helping in suggesting the most appropriate candidates according to the given job description. Our system uses Natural Language Processing to extract relevant information about the skills of the candidate from resumes and hence creates a summarised form of each application. With all the irrelevant information removed, the task of screening is simplified and recruiters are able to better analyse each resume in less time. It provides visual analytics for skills in resumes and then can then be utilised to determine best-fitting candidates for that particular job opening.
